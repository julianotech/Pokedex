# :video_game: Pokedex
This is my sixth android project following the instructions of Marty Stepp on Stanford University,
course CS 193A: Android App Development, Winter 2017. https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193a/index.shtml

Note: I've got a problem with GitHub connection, the YouTube lesson is frozen
and it is not synchronized so, the progress cannot be tracked because
I had to upload everything after finished it by complete

# ‚ù§ Motivation

Since I have finished my first information technology university I am thinking to become a developer, however, I used to work too much and now I have got a free time to develop this dream.

# ‚ö† Prerequisites

These requirements will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See Installation for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Please, visit the following  link to check the material requirements: http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193a/links.shtml

The Stanford Android Library written by Marty Stepp (stepp AT stanford DOT edu) :  http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193a/lib/

Make sure you are able to download this entire project code available on GitHub.

To be able to run this game you need to have installed Android Studio (at least 2.3) with an AVD configured. 

A recent version of the Android SDK (at least API 19). 

Oracle Java Development Kit ("JDK")

Optional: You can also run it on your own android mobile device using a USB cable and even exporting a .apk file.

Once the project is open, your environment should be ready to build and run the project.

# ‚òë Tests

I have tested on Android Studio using AVD for Nexus API 27 by Google Inc.

Looking to improve the AVD performance I have used Genymotion virtual devices to emulate a Samsung Galaxy S4 4.4.4 - API 19 with successful.
